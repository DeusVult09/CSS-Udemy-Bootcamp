## Reflection

Working through these exercises from this section helped me to build a solid foundation in CSS. I learned how to apply styles using different types of selectors, how to group/chain them, how to apply different properties such as color, text-align, font-size etc. Foundation exercises also helped me think more attentively about organizing CSS in a neat and scalable way.
