- Box Model
- CSS POsitioning: static, relative, absolute
- Inline and block displays

## Skills Demonstrated

- Applying the CSS Box Model: margin, border, padding, to the content
- Differentiating between block-level and inline-level elements
- Changing element display behavior using the display property
- Inspecting and debugging layout issues using browser developer tools
- Writing clean CSS for layout structure

## REflection

Working through these practice sessions helped me understand how CSS can change layout and structure. Concepts like the box model, padding, and margins became much clearer when I saw how they changed the spacing and appearance of elements 
I also started to recognize how different display types,like block and inline can affect the flow of content on a page. While some parts were challenging at first, repeating the exercises gave me more confidence. Now I feel more confident using CSS to structure elements and control layout.
