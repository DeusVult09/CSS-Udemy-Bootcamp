# CSS Udemy Bootcamp Practice Sessions (From Introduction to Advanced)

## The goal of these practice sessions is to strengthen the understanding of CSS through hands-on exercises based on the curriculum from Udemy Bootcamp. The entire folder falls into introduction, intermediate and adnvanced CSS parts covering the following topics:

- CSS selectors (class, ID, element)
- Descendant combinator
- Grouping selectors
- Chaining multiple class selectors
- Combining class and ID selectors
- CSS properties: background-color, color, text-align, font-size, font-weight, font-family, etc.
- CSS cascade: type, specificity, importance, and order of rules
- Writing clean and maintainable CSS
- Linking CSS using:
- Inline
- Internal (<style>)
- External (<link href="..." />)
- Using relative paths for linking CSS files
- CSS Cascade
- Box Model
- CSS Positioning: static, relative, absolute
- Inline and block
- Wrapping text using float property
- Using different methods for building website responsiveness (in particular media queries)

## Skills Demonstrated

- Clean, organized CSS syntax
- Using relative paths correctly
- Structuring selectors for clarity and minimal duplication
- Applying unique styles using IDs
- Smart use of class chaining and grouping
- Understanding how the CSS cascade affects rule application
- Applying the CSS Box Model: margin, border, padding, to the content
- Differentiating between block-level and inline-level elements
- Changing element display behavior using the display property
- Inspecting and debugging layout issues using browser developer tools
- Writing clean CSS for layout structure

## Reflection

Overall, the exercises were manageable and quick to complete. Still, a few key lessons stood out:

- Writing clean CSS isn’t just about syntax but it’s about thinking 'ergonomically' and writing flexible, scalable code.
- I learned to be more intentional with selectors to avoid unnecessary complexity or bloated code (this is the area I am still working on)
- I want to continue improving how I choose selectors and structure styles to stay DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and efficient, time-saving.
