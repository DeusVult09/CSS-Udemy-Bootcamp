## Advanced CSS practice exercises targeted the following topics:

- Responsive layout system using Media Queries
- Text flow control with "float" and "clear" property
- **Project:** Building and styling a responsive landing page

## Skills Demonstrated

- Building layout using responsive principles
- Creating responsive design with media queries
- Wrapping text with the `float` property
- Building a responsive landing page 

## Reflection

This section helped me understand how to build web pages that fit different screen sizes using media queries. I gained confidence working with layout techniques. The landing page project was very challenging for me because I could not properly combine theory and practice but in the end thanks to multiple revisions could achieve what was expected from me.
